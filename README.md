## ðŸ›  Technologies

Project was built using **React Native** and **Expo** in addition to the following dependencies:

- **[React Native Gesture Handler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-gesture-handler)** - Declarative API exposing platform native touch and gesture system to React Native.

- **[React Native Maps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-maps)** - This Map component is built so that features on the map (such as Markers, Polygons, etc.) are specified as children of the MapView itself. This provides an intuitive and react-like API for declaratively controlling features on the map.

- **[React Native Screens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-screens)** - This project aims to expose native navigation container components to React Native.

- **[React Native Vector Icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-vector-icons)** - Perfect for buttons, logos and nav/tab bars. Easy to extend, style and integrate into your project.

- **[Babel Plugin React Native Web](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-screens)** - A Babel plugin that will alias `react-native` to `react-native-web` and exclude any modules not required by your app (keeping bundle size down).

- **[React Navigation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-navigation)** - Is born from the React Native community's need for an extensible yet easy-to-use navigation solution based on JavaScript.

- **[React Navigation Stack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-navigation-stack)** - Stack navigator for use on iOS and Android.

- **[React Redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-redux)** - Official React bindings for Redux. Performant and flexible.

- **[Redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)** - Is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

- **[Redux Thunk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-thunk)** - Thunk middleware for Redux. It allows writing functions with logic inside that can interact with a Redux store's dispatch and getState methods.

- **[ESLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint)** - Is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions

- **[Jest Expo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-expo)** - Preset to painlessly test your Expo / React Native apps.

- **[Prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier)** - Is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
